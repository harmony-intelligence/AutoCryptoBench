Regularly updated list of Bitcoin-friendly VPS, dedicated server, VDS, VPN, email, and domain hosting providers.

Fight for Bitcoin privacy! The United Nations, the United States, the European Union (Russia & China too) are waging a global war on Bitcoin and crypto privacy. The US even wants to require KYC for all hosting providers! KYC harms innocent people and is useless against real criminals. It may even encourage new forms of crime! If these trends continue, many privacy-friendly server providers on this page would likely have to shut down or require you to provide obscene amounts of personal information. But it's not too late to stop it. Tell your government that this will kill your access to the world's fastest-growing industry while imposing massive costs that bring almost no benefits. Please support people like the Open Dialogue Foundation/BTC Coalition, Patrick Hansen (Unstoppable Finance), Patrick Breyer (Pirate Party), Mikołaj Barczentewicz, and CoinCenter who are fighting against these insane ideas. And remember, privacy-hostile KYC didn't prevent the FTX collapse!

Search providers by location: locations are tagged by ISO country code. You can search by pressing Ctrl-F/Cmd-F, enabling case sensitive/"match case" in the dialog box, and searching in the page text for e.g RO to find all providers with locations in Romania. 2-letter country codes are listed here.

Make sure to include server and company locations. If they use BitPay, Coinbase, Coingate, or Cryptomus please flag this. Additional notes (what level of anonymity is allowed at signup, whether they offer block storage / are suited to running Bitcoin full nodes, etc) are welcome. Particularly interested in hosts that take Lightning payments and hosts in exotic locations. Yes, you can request listing for a company you own or work for, we love to hear from providers.

Using BitPay, Coinbase, Coingate, Cryptomus or using providers that require it is discouraged: many readers have complained BitPay requires a separate account and extensive personal information from the customer in order to pay for services from BitPay-using merchants. Coinbase, Coingate, and Cryptomus have similar issues, see our suggestions for hosting providers page.

Due to draconian new laws being pushed worldwide, we STRONGLY recommend hosting providers move to self-hosted payment processing (e.g BTCPayServer). We have a suggestions for hosting providers page with more information on this, along with some other tips.

Hat tip to joepie91 for creating the first list.

"It's a really useful list! One of the few "lists of Bitcoin businesses" that even considers things like self-hosted payment handling. It was pretty easy to find a VPS for hosting my new Tor relay. --Wladimir van der Laan, longest-serving Bitcoin Core Lead Maintainer

"You know that whole NSA story from almost ten years ago? I paid for the servers that made that possible... using Bitcoin." --Edward Snowden
